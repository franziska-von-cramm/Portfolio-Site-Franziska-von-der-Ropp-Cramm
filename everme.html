                        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                        <p>EverMe is a website where memorial pages can be created, regardless of whether it is about a
                            deceased relative or the beloved pet.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to the possibility to create memorial pages,
                            there is also a store where a created memorial page can be connected with a QR code product
                            for
                            the gravestone.
                            The website is thus intended to help the mourner in a convenient way to commemorate in a
                            timely
                            manner and to preserve memories.
                        </p>
                        <p>EverMe is a fictional website created by me. I started the website as a voluntary practice
                            project in 2021 in wix.com.
                            After the UX design course on the CareerFoundry platform, I redesigned the project again in
                            Figma.
                            In this process, I did user research after the fact and created user personas. When creating
                            the
                            designs,
                            I also mainly followed guidelines from Material Design.

                        <p>To begin, I searched the market for similar memorial sites. The focus of the analyses was on:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Popularity</li>

                            <li>Reviews</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Analyzed websites:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gedenkseiten.de</li>
                            <li>e-memoria.de</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Gedenkseiten.de is by far the most popular and well-known website for memorial pages.
                            It has by far a high number of active users compared to similar services.
                        </p>
                        <p>e-memoria.de is a lesser-known website, but it stands out for its special function of
                            providing QR codes for the gravestone with the memorial pages it creates.
                            A function that has a particularly positive effect on the ratings.

                <p>In the next step, I created a user persona that helps me put myself in the shoes of my target
                    users and design the website according to their needs and desires.

                        <h3>Redesign</h3>
                        <p>I originally created the website using the wix.com platform in a modular system.
                            For practice purposes I decided to re-design the website in Figma. I used the known
                            guidelines
                            of Material Design for the design.

                    <div>
                        <h3>The structure</h3>
                        <p>During the redesign process, I largely retained the structure of the website. With the
                            information from the analyses,
                            user stories and user personas, I was able to add useful details and information to the
                            website in order to create a product that always has the user and his wishes in mind.

                    <p>To simplify the process, I created most of the elements and components using auto layouts and
                        constraints.
                        This makes it much easier to add or delete elements after the fact, as the entire design
                        adjusts automatically.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <h3>User centered design</h3>
                <p>Although I have already started this project once before via the wix.com platform, I have
                    been
                    able to develop the project enormously in its function and presentation.
                    Even though both versions are still similar in their basic structure, some usability
                    problems of
                    the predecessor could be uncovered and corrected.
