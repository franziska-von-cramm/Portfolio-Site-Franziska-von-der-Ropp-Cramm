                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>OLIVE is a responsive health app. In addition to being able to set goals and new habits to
                    improve lifestyle,
                    users should also be able to have live video calls with coaches or doctors to improve their
                    health.

                            as losing weight, staying physically active, or learning about an acute illness and
                            adopt a better lifestyle.

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>I started with the competitive analysis and analyzed similar apps on the market in more
                    detail. These provided me with a lot of useful insights into the features, structure and design
                    solutions of the apps.
                    Then I wrote user stories and job stories to make sure that my features are based on what the users
                    want.

                        <p>To further explore the problem area, I conducted 4 Skype interviews with users from the
                            target audience and used Affinity Mapping to organize the data and capture the results

                <p>The use of qualitative and quantitative research methods proved to be an excellent means of
                    identifying the characteristic needs and goals of the user group I was targeting.
                </p>
                <p>This helped me to put myself in the shoes of my target group and create two user personas: Mark

                <h2>Wireframes and Prototype</h2>
                <p>After interviewing users and gathering all the information needed to understand the user and
                    their needs, I created a paper prototype
                    at the beginning of the design phase. This helped me sort out my thoughts and get an overall
                    idea of what forms my design could
                    take. As I gained a deeper understanding of the concept, I created medium quality wireframes
                    that I then merged into an initial prototype in Adobe XD/Figma.

                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>The only way to verify the usefulness of a design or prototype is to test it with real
                    people. For this reason, I conducted a
                    preference test on Usability Hub. This was to find out which design of physician information
                    would resonate better with participants.
                    There were 11 participants in total. Also, basic functions were to be tested:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Test how easy it is for the new user to log in. Are there any
                        friction points or hesitation in disclosing information?</li>
                    <li>Can the user follow the onboarding information and set and
                        view their first new destination?</li>
                    <li>How easy is it to book a call with a doctor? Are all the options
                        given that the user wants?</li>
                    <li>Does the user understand how to keep the booked
                        appointment with the doctor?</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Comments</h3>
                <p>There were many comments in general about my OLIVE prototype. These comments encouraged me in
                    what I was doing and show that I
                    was on the right track with my prototype. After the course was finished, I continued to
                    develop my prototype privately. In Figma I
                    reworked it a bit and added some animations.
