                        <h3>The Story</h3>
                        <p>As a Carrerfoundry student in the UX design immersion course, I had the task of designing a
                            responsive web app.
                        </p>
                        <p>I decided to use the OLIVE Health app. In addition to allowing users to set goals and new
                            habits to improve their lifestyle,
                            the app also needed to allow users to make live video calls with coaches or doctors to
                            improve their health.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
                        <p>At the beginning of my design process, I define the core problem I want to solve.</p>
                        <h3>Problem definition</h3>
                        <p>People who are under a lot of stress in their professional or personal lives need a way to
                            adopt a better lifestyle with new goals and habits.</p>
                        <p>We will know this is true when these people report that they are more relaxed in their daily
                            lives and feel better psychologically.</p>

                        <p>Next, I want to find out what similar services and products are already on the market and how
                            they solve the problem I want to solve.
                            To this end, I analyzed and reviewed two potential competitors for my product, the Mindshine
                            app and Remente app.
                        </p>
                        <p>What I liked most about the Mindshine app was that users were able to formulate their own
                            goals in addition to set goals.
                            This way, people can adopt new habits at their own pace without overwhelming themselves at
                            the beginning.

                        <p>
                            Based on this research, I created user stories to drive my app project.</p>

                            <li>As a user, I want to be able to search and find other features of the app in an easy to

                            <li>As a user who uses the app daily, I would like to have a calendar feature that allows me
                                to track my last few days to give me an overview of my performance so far.</li>
                            <li>As a user, I would like to receive daily tips and advice from the app to learn more
                                about health and develop new habits on a daily basis.</li>
                            <li>When I create an account, I want to have an onboarding process to get to know the app
                                better so I can use it more effectively.</li>
                            <li>When I load a new health app on my phone, I want to get through the sign-up process
                                quickly so I can get help and advice as soon as possible.</li>

                    <p>To further explore the problem area, I conducted 4 Skype interviews with users from the
                        target group and used affinity mapping to organize the data and capture the results.

                            <li>deeper understanding of how users learn about health and fitness, and what motivates
                                them and plays a role in doing so.</li>

                        <h4>Key insights</h4>
                        <p>All respondents downloaded health or fitness apps for different reasons. Motives include
                            losing weight, staying physically active or finding out about an acute illness.
                            Many of the users also said they were not motivated enough to use an app regularly over a
                            longer period of time.</p>
                        <p>The key to arousing their interest in a health app is through an individualized
                            questionnaire.
                            This ensures that the app responds to the user's wishes and needs and suggests suitable
                            goals and advice. This can be achieved through a personalized questionnaire.
                            In order to constantly maintain motivation, it also makes sense to integrate a reward
                            system.</p>

                        <h3>User Personas</h3>
                        <p>The use of qualitative and quantitative research methods proved to be an excellent means of
                            identifying the characteristic needs and goals of the user group I was targeting.
                        </p>
                        <p>These personas formed the basis for my information hierarchy and the general flow of the app,
                            which was tailored to their goals and needs.
                            This helped me empathize with my target audience and create two user personas: Mark and
                            Jenny.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes and Prototype</h2>
                <p>After interviewing users and gathering all the information needed to understand the user and
                    their needs, I created a paper prototype
                    at the beginning of the design phase. This helped me sort out my thoughts and get an overall
                    idea of what forms my design could
                    take. As I gained a deeper understanding of the concept, I created medium quality wireframes
                    that I then merged into an initial prototype in Adobe XD/Figma.

                    <p>The only way to verify the usefulness of a design or prototype is to test it with real
                        people. For this reason, I conducted a
                        preference test on Usability Hub. This was to find out which design of physician information
                        would resonate better with participants.
                        There were 11 participants in total. Also, basic functions were to be tested:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Test how easy it is for the new user to log in. Are there any
                            friction points or hesitation in disclosing information?</li>
                        <li>Can the user follow the onboarding information and set and
                            view their first new destination?</li>
                        <li>How easy is it to book a call with a doctor? Are all the options
                            given that the user wants?</li>
                        <li>Does the user understand how to keep the booked
                            appointment with the doctor?</li>

                        <h3>Trust in the process</h3>
                        <p>Like many designers, I'm always tempted to jump right into the visual design and start too
                            early with the UI details.
                            Applying design thinking to his project reminded me once again that not every phase of a
                            project needs to be perfect before moving on.
                        </p>
                        <p>Incremental improvements based on feedback from real users are at the heart of the iterative
                            process. Design is never finished,
                            but working on the Olive project showed me that trusting the process is worthwhile and also
                            helped me internalize that done is better than perfect.</p>

                        <h3>Credits</h3>
                        <p>I developed Olive as part of the Carrerfoundry UX Immersion Course.
                            It was a hard piece of work, but I am very happy with the result and hope for many more
                            exciting UX projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>A big thank you to my family for the great support and motivation during this project. And
                            also a huge thank you to my friends
                            and all the other UX designers from the CF community who sacrificed their valuable time to
                            participate in my testing.</p>
