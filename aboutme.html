                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>My name is Franziska v. der Ropp-Cramm, I am 28 years old and I am passionate aboutUI/UX
                            Design.</p>
                        <p>My professional career started with a studies in Game Art and 3D Animation at the SAE
                            Institute
                            in Stuttgart,which I successfully completed until September 2019.</p>
                        <p>After my bachelor studies which I finished with the highest grade (1st class), I was lucky
                            enough to apply my acquired knowledge and skills as a 3D Artist at AR-Werk GmbH.
                            In this position I was able to expand my knowledge in the 3D field and at the same time I
                            developed a strong interest in web design and application design.
                            Since AR-Werk GmbH was a startup, I also took on cross-positional tasks that allowed me to
                            take my first professional steps in the field of UI/UX design.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, my employment ended during the Corona pandemic, a time that provided many
                            challenges, especially in finding a suitable position as a 3D artist.
                            During this time, however, a strong desire developed in me to delve more deeply into UI/UX
                            design and acquire further skills in this area. For this reason,
                            I participated in various UI/UX online courses on the platform Udemy, started a voluntary
                            project on wix.com and decided to take the full-time course "UX Design Program" from
                            Careerfoundry.
                            During this highly practical course, I gained extensive insight into the varied tasks and
                            activities of a UX designer and had the opportunity to put user-centered designs into
                            practice.
                            The highlight of my work during this course was undoubtedly the development of my own
                            interactive prototype - Olive, the health app.</p>
                        <p>Being employed by Seeburger AG made me realize how important it is, as a designer, to follow
                            the processes and procedures of the developers to ensure a smooth workflow in order to
                            create innovative and user-centered solutions.
                            For this reason, I decided to deal more intensively with frontend development and to gain
                            additional competencies in this area through further education. </p>
                        <p>Currently, I am therefore now attending the full-time online course "Frontend Development for
                            Designers" via the platform CareerFoundry, which started on 11.09. and has a duration of 2
                            months.
                            In this course, which is also very practice-oriented, I am learning how to use HTML, CSS and
                            JavaScript on my own in order to further deepen my skills as a UI/UX designer.
