                            <h2>About Me</h2>
                            <p>My name is Franziska v. der Ropp-Cramm and I am 28 years old. After my bachelor studies,
                                which I finished with the best grade in 2019,
                                I had the opportunity to apply my acquired knowledge and skills as a 3D artist at
                                AR-Werk GmbH. Since AR-Werk GmbH was a startup,
                                I also took on cross-job tasks that gave me my first insights and professional steps in
                                the field of UI/UX design. In this way,
                                I was able to expand my expertise in 3D while developing a strong interest in web and
                                application design.
                            </p>

                        <div>
                            <h2>Motivation</h2>
                            <p>My professional goal changed when I was employed by AR-Werk because I had insights into
                                the field of UI/UX design.
                                I have discovered a new field of interest, which gave me a lot of pleasure in its
                                implementation.
                                A desire has arisen in me to further explore UI/UX design and gain more knowledge in
                                this field.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Abilities</h2>
                            <p>Through my experiences from my last jobs, as well as the hands-on courses and projects, I
                                was able to gain experience in all areas:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Creating mockups, wireframes and interactive prototypes</li>

                                    table)</li>
                                <li>Creating high-quality product designs with accessibility in mind (Material Design

                            <h2>UX Design Program - Career Foundry</h2>
                            <p>During this highly hands-on course, I gained extensive insight into the varied tasks and
                                activities
                                of a UX designer and had the opportunity to put user-centered designs into practice.
                                The highlight of my work during this course was undoubtedly the development of my own
                                interactive prototype - Olive, the health app.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Being employed at Seeburger AG as a UI Designer/ Visual Designer made me realize how
                                important it is as a designer to be
                                able to follow the processes and workflows of the developers to ensure a smooth workflow
                                and thus create innovative and user-centered solutions.
                                Therefore, I decided to deal more intensively with frontend development and to gain
                                additional competencies in this area through further education.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the context of this advanced training I program my portfolio site from scratch with
                                HTML, CSS and Java Script with all important functions and content.
                                I will continue to maintain it after the completion of the training and take up new
                                projects.
